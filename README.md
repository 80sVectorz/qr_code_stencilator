# QR Code Stencilator

![Example](https://github.com/80sVectorz/qr_code_stencilator/blob/main/documentation/example.gif?raw=true)

A tool that lets you generate the stencils to paint a QR code with two colors

# Original problem & usage example

I originally made this program for a friend, but I thought it would be nice to make it public.

# Disclaimer
Support is focused on Windows, but it probably works on Linux too.

# Installation
Download the latest zip file from [releases](https://github.com/80sVectorz/qr_code_stencilator/releases)
and extract it somewhere.
For now you'll need basic command line knowledge to use this program.
To get info on how to use the program use the help flag:  
`qr_code_stencilator.exe --help`

# Future plans
Things I already plan to implement are: 
- Support for more advanced instructions to create multiple version of a QR code in one go.
- A GUI version
